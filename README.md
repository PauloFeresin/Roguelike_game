# Roguelike_game

A roguelike type game where I'm implementing new functionalities as I go.
Right now, we have a "dynamic" map, with FoV and fog of war. The map is generated randomly.
There's currently two type of enemies, with diferent stats.

The players is caracterized as a "@". It can damage enemies, receive damage and die.

Future improvements: More enemies, more players "classes", items, levelup system.

Huge thanks to https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/ where I found inspiration and learned all of this stuff.
